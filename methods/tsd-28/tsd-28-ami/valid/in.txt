<other> um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . <EOS> so we 're designing a new remote control and um um , as you can see it 's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . <EOS> um and so there are three different stages to the design . <EOS> so we 're gon na have like individual work and then a meeting about it . <EOS> and repeat that process three times . <EOS> <laugh> so uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . <EOS> my favourite animal is like a beagle . <EOS> uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . <EOS> and , yeah that they have lots of personality well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . <EOS> then they 're small cute and furry , and i kind of like whales . <EOS> they come in and go < sound imitating devouring something > eat everything in sight . <EOS> <laugh> m my favourite animal is my own dog at home . <EOS> um he 's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , <EOS>
um so according to the brief um we 're gon na be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and uh we do n't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . <EOS> but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? <EOS> i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it 's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . <EOS> um . <EOS> i mean do you think the fact that it 's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? <EOS> like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . <EOS> well twenty five euro , i mean that 's um that 's about like eighteen pounds or something , thi is this gon na to be like the premium product kinda thing or so i do n't know how how good a remote control that would get you . <EOS> um . <EOS>
um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . <EOS> well right away i 'm wondering if there 's um th th uh , like with d _ v _ d _ players , if there are zones . <EOS> 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . <EOS> i 'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it 'll be different , so thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , but yeah , i suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . <EOS> so extra functionalities . <EOS> so , like , i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v _ c _ r _ and everything ? <EOS> maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . <EOS> w you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . <EOS> maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . <EOS> s maybe like a touch screen or something ? <EOS> or whatever would be technologically reasonable . <EOS> i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , i think one factor would be production cost . <EOS>
um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you 're gon na be working on you know the actual working design of it <EOS>
um for user interface , technical functions , <EOS>
um and uh marketing executive , you 'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil <EOS>
um so according to the brief um we 're gon na be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , well twenty five euro , i mean that 's um that 's about like eighteen pounds or something , <EOS>
i mean do you think the fact that it 's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? <EOS> well right away i 'm wondering if there 's um th th uh , like with d _ v _ d _ players , if there are zones . <EOS>
and uh we do n't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . <EOS>
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? <EOS> or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? <EOS> so extra functionalities . <EOS> so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses <EOS>
um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one <other> is that um uh the company 's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . <EOS> so we do n't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . <EOS> um they 've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v _ c _ r _ , d _ v _ d _ or anything else . <EOS> i think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it 'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . <EOS> so um , we 're just gon na keep it simple and it 'll just control the t _ v _ . <EOS> and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . <EOS> um i 'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . <EOS> it might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . <EOS> and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? <EOS> <other> uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . <EOS> i mean do they <other> is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it 's quite long . <EOS> so those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the t _ v _ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . <EOS>
so this is the technical functions design . <EOS> to do the um <other> the design i have i 've had a look online , i 've had a look at the homepage , um i 've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer um , having a look at the existing products , i found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there 's either um a very complicated one that 's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you do n't know what you 're doing . <EOS> <other> um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . <EOS> here um the button there and there . <EOS> that one 's perg and that one 's prog , and it does n't really tell you what it does . <EOS> um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . <EOS> um it 's a very simple one . <EOS> it 's got only the basic functions mm but um <other> it 's the same size as the the hard to use one . <EOS> <other> uh it looked a bit clunky . <EOS> they 're very big and not very much use for buttons . <EOS> and it 's just very hard to access the advanced functions . <EOS> um , my own preferences , i prefer the the clunky one . <EOS> <other> um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , so , <other> now i 'd like to ask for your preferences . <EOS> which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right ? . <EOS> . <EOS> <other> um , the clunky one is the one on the right . <EOS> um i think it 's supposed to be the same size , but um it 's got much fewer buttons . <EOS> and then others that are concealed . <EOS>
well i think it 's a valid point . <EOS> i mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , um so i see i see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , um , <other> do we have any functions that um we 'd want on it ? <EOS> i mean so far i 've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . <EOS> and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . <EOS> um , you say that 's a h a required one or a requested one ? <EOS> god , i wou i would say that 's required , i mean there 's no way anybody 's gon na buy a remote control these days when if you ca n't actually individually select channels , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , well i think i think es essentially what we 're doing right now is we 're categorising . <EOS> we 're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? <EOS> um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they 're possible . <EOS> there 's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . <EOS> um , so so far , just to recap you 've got volume and channel control and well , one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it 's very clear what they want to do where they go . <EOS> uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wan na be acc easily accessible . <EOS> for example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . <EOS> maybe they 're un they 're they 're they 're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . <EOS> and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , <EOS>
i dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there 'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh <laugh> the things . <EOS> what i 've already started doing is cr i created a slide in in my presentation here so that we kind of think well what 's the cumulative effect of what we 've taken from your ideas and and mine , obviously obviously what you 've just told me what you 've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that i 've been mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah . <EOS> before i bring this up what i 'll just say is um what i 've what i 've done is tried to collect some information so that i can then relay this to to you guys so that it 's now becomes a collective thing . <EOS> and then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide so what i basically got is i just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and what kind of decisions we could take away from it so um i 'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , and what are issues with with um existing products . <EOS> and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision so this is what i 've found here , um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . <EOS> most people find them ugly . <EOS> um <other> the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we 'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . <EOS> um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . <EOS> they tend to use the most simple controls if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that 's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . <EOS> and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people 's hands . <EOS> they get lost a lot , um , takes time to learn how to use them . <EOS> and i will admit i do n't know what r _ s _ i _ stands for . <EOS> uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . <EOS> now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . <EOS> if that 's possible we might consider getting into it . <EOS> i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that 's fashionable and sleek and trendy . <EOS> you know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . <EOS> so it you wan na group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <EOS> my hope here is that i 'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . <EOS> um i i have n't brought out one specific marketing idea , <other> well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we 're gon na be um who 's our our target audience , our target market . <EOS> um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? <EOS> where 's the money , maybe . <EOS> yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . <EOS> it 's somebody who 's not gon na just use the remote that comes with their telly , i suppose , um , i think it 'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . <EOS> um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . <EOS> 'cause twenty five euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? <EOS> is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? <EOS> mostly focused around the twenty five age group . <EOS> sort of young professional , kind of . <EOS> mm-hmm um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? <EOS> it does it does fit with the market that we 're sort of identifying , i think we are gon na have to narrow it down , and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . <EOS> if we are going to include speech recognition , it 's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . <EOS> i i think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . <EOS> so these are people who are gadgety , right ? <EOS> so they 'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . <EOS> so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition i i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because um , based on what you 've go y everybody 's saying , right , you want something simple . <EOS> speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . <EOS> could it be an on off thing ? <EOS> but what i 'm saying is that we 're we 're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we 're gon na say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . <EOS> but at end of the day we do n't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . <EOS> is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that 's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . <EOS> and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , i reckon one problem with speech recognition is um i 've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one was n't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . <EOS> do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it 's worthwhile incorporating it though ? <EOS> i think it 'd probably quite expensive to put in . <EOS>
well this is just the working design um . <EOS> um i guess i try to define like what we 're doing now , but we 're we ca n't n we have n't narrowed down um exactly what the things we 're trying to fulfil , like i think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . <EOS> has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . <EOS> so i 'll go into the diagram first . <EOS> it just explains how the process goes through , from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need you need some power source . <EOS> 'kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . <EOS> um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . <EOS> like for example , voice recognition , right . <EOS> that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , so that 's one perhaps constraint there . <EOS> <other> th okay , the basic thing is there 's a user interface you know , and that um picks up an input from a user , a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself like um voice recognition , right , if it 's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we do n't have enough power . <EOS> maybe you you wan na go back to what the functions are ? <EOS> well , do you wan do you wan na finish up your your whole presentation then ? <EOS> yeah , w i 'm done . <EOS> um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , since we 're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like what are our options ? <EOS> is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin um , these these are n't technology options in that sense . <EOS> a basic principles and basic components that are needed . <EOS> so each component represents one function , but i think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you wo n't have to care about . <EOS> um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the t _ v _ for example . <EOS> okay , um are we gon na restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? <EOS> because that 's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . <EOS> right . <EOS> well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so i th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface um because i mean it it 's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha um if somebody 's gon na h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . <EOS> so because if you 're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the t _ v _ 's at that chair , and i 'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . <EOS> uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , there 's there 's not much specific specific information , in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t _ v _ , um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? <EOS> or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? <EOS> okay , from from a from a component point of view there 's added complexity , and you add cost to it , you need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . <EOS> or you need to get the user to plug it in . <EOS> um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . <EOS> then i do n't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . <EOS> okay , so just stick to to regular <EOS>
i 'm just gon na just recap uh what i said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we 're gon na aim this at , are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? <EOS> yeah , that 's good . <EOS> i think we just say that it was gon na be the the most basic stuff possible . <EOS> um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . <EOS> um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it 's gon na do . <EOS> and is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some yeah , it 's as optional functions . <EOS> 'cause what what i 'm i 'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it 's does n't have that . <EOS> another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? <EOS> um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . <EOS> one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . <EOS> i mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , and then from there decide whether it 's basic , or it 's non-basic . <EOS> mm okay , great . <EOS> device is basically anything which we ca n't categorise , right . <EOS> shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we 'll u use this idea david 's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we 're talking about this . <EOS> yeah , yeah i think that 's definitely a good idea . <EOS> so you 're gon na have um audio which is gon na be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi and then video is anything that you can see . <EOS> okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then k i suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard um so yeah , i guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it 's got ta look good , um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . <EOS> make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , <EOS>
um for uh our industrial designer , you 're gon na be thinking about the components concept . <EOS>
um user interface designer gon na be thinking about our user interface , <EOS>
and marketing you 're gon na be thinking about trend watching . <EOS>
which is the the first one <other> is that um uh the company 's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . <EOS> so we do n't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . <EOS>
um they 've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v _ c _ r _ , d _ v _ d _ or anything else . <EOS> so um , we 're just gon na keep it simple and it 'll just control the t _ v _ . <EOS>
and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . <EOS>
i mean so far i 've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . <EOS> and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . <EOS> um , so so far , just to recap you 've got volume and channel control and there 's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . <EOS> i think we just say that it was gon na be the the most basic stuff possible . <EOS> um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . <EOS>
one is that we want uh something that 's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . <EOS> and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people 's hands . <EOS> um so yeah , i guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it 's got ta look good , <EOS>
okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . <EOS> are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? <EOS> yeah , that 's good . <EOS>
um because i mean it it 's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha <EOS>
then i do n't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . <EOS> okay , so just stick to to regular <EOS>
well i think i think es essentially what we 're doing right now is we 're categorising . <EOS> we 're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? <EOS> um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they 're possible . <EOS> well , one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it 's very clear what they want to do where they go . <EOS> uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wan na be acc easily accessible . <EOS> for example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . <EOS> maybe they 're un they 're they 're they 're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . <EOS> and then others that are concealed . <EOS> so it you wan na group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <EOS> another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? <EOS> um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . <EOS> one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . <EOS> i mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , and then from there decide whether it 's basic , or it 's non-basic . <EOS> mm okay , great . <EOS> shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we 'll u use this idea david 's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we 're talking about this . <EOS> yeah , yeah i think that 's definitely a good idea . <EOS> device is basically anything which we ca n't categorise , right . <EOS> so you 're gon na have um audio which is gon na be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi and then video is anything that you can see . <EOS> okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , <EOS>
<other> um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wan na be acc easily accessible . <EOS> so that for the user it 's very clear what they want to do where they go . <EOS> for example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . <EOS> maybe they 're un they 're they 're they 're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . <EOS> and then others that are concealed . <EOS> so it you wan na group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <EOS>
<other> well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we 're gon na be um who 's our our target audience , our target market . <EOS> um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? <EOS> where 's the money , maybe . <EOS> yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . <EOS> it 's somebody who 's not gon na just use the remote that comes with their telly , i suppose , um , i think it 'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . <EOS> um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . <EOS> mostly focused around the twenty five age group . <EOS> sort of young professional , kind of . <EOS> mm-hmm i think we are gon na have to narrow it down , i i think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well so these are people who are gadgety , right ? <EOS> so they 'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . <EOS>
if that 's possible we might consider getting into it . <EOS> um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? <EOS> it does it does fit with the market that we 're sort of identifying , and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . <EOS> if we are going to include speech recognition , it 's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . <EOS> so they 'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . <EOS> so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition i i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because um , based on what you 've go y everybody 's saying , right , you want something simple . <EOS> speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . <EOS> could it be an on off thing ? <EOS> but what i 'm saying is that we 're we 're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we 're gon na say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . <EOS> but at end of the day we do n't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . <EOS> is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that 's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . <EOS> and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , i reckon one problem with speech recognition is um i 've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one was n't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . <EOS> do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it 's worthwhile incorporating it though ? <EOS> i think it 'd probably quite expensive to put in . <EOS>
<other> um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , maybe they 're un they 're they 're they 're in a little area but covered up um , and then others that are concealed . <EOS> 'cause what what i 'm i 'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it 's does n't have that . <EOS> is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some <EOS>
i 'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . <EOS> decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gon na be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we 're gon na group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um <other> . <EOS> and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t _ v _ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . <EOS>
uh basically what i wan na do here , before we get into it uh too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . <EOS> okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . <EOS> number two was that it be innovative . <EOS> uh and third priority uh for ease of use , is that i think um <other> what we should think about is how the um <other> about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . <EOS> uh top european fashion trend um <other> that i read about says there 's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . <EOS> so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um softness in materials , shape , and function , so i 'm thinking if we imagine that we 're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we 're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , uh sorta like a marketing identity . <EOS> like um the ones the ones which i 'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . <EOS>
um there 's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so i 've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um we 're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . <EOS> um the shape of the control , um what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . <EOS> um they 're not very attractive to look at , <other> and they 're not very comfortable to hold , and they 're very easily lost . <EOS> um for instance , the stand-by button is n't always red , <EOS>
<other> the buttons should be large . <EOS> they should be easy to press , very comfortable . <EOS> so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that 's kinda confusing . <EOS> um should avoid s things like that . <EOS> um <other> if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . <EOS> any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , <other> um if we did decide to go for voice activation <other> there sh should always be a button as alternative , um <other> we should definitely avoid the big square block look . <EOS> <other> and they 've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . <EOS> so it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take um i do n't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . <EOS> i think it 's um , fashion into electronics . <EOS> and we do n't know how flexible the colour scheme is . <EOS>
um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . <EOS> and the power is basically a factor of that . <EOS> um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , so i guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . <EOS> um i 'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause i got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . <EOS> um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . <EOS> i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . <EOS> okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there 's an l _ c _ d _ display , okay um then there 's um how the case actually looks . <EOS> it can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um i do n't think you can use them in a combination , um i think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . <EOS> um and the other components are logic chips , um again i 'll i 'll go back to the component chips . <EOS> the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um i do n't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . <EOS> power consumption should be about the same . <EOS> um and the other thing is um the power options . <EOS> um the first one is a standard battery . <EOS> okay the second one i think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it 's a wind-up < sounds imitating winding up > you know , a crank <laugh> . <EOS> i think that 's more of a look and feel decision because i do n't think you can have one power source if you 're using the alternative power sources . <EOS> i think whatever it is you still need a battery okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , um and the kinetic one i guess for me is the most interesting one you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . <EOS> i guess that 's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you ca n't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . <EOS> um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . <EOS> um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . <EOS> the user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the l _ c _ d _ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . <EOS> <other> um the case okay with a rubber case you ca n't have the solar panels . <EOS> titanium case ca n't be curved , it has to be square . <EOS> okay um there 's no restriction on the plastic , and on the wood . <EOS> um i think we could because the l _ c _ d _ panel requires power , and the l _ c _ d _ is a form of a light <EOS>
we 're gon na need to put in a really good battery so people do n't have to charge their r remote control every few days . <EOS> um that 's why i think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch but are people gon na wan na shake their movie controller ? <EOS> um it 's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . <EOS> um <other> i think we could go for like um <other> maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . <EOS> um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . <EOS> um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . <EOS> so something quite curvy ? <EOS> about how if you have a bright colour you 'll not lose it so much . <EOS> um and when the corporate colour is yellow , i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . <EOS> um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um <other> the colour , 'cause i i i was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they 're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . <EOS> it feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . <EOS> i 'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . <EOS> um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . <EOS> so i reckon it 'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . <EOS> the fact that it talks to you , i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , i think that 'd probably scare me . <EOS> also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l _ c _ d _ display , where would we put that ? <EOS> do we need an l _ c _ d _ display ? <EOS> it 's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , i would 've thought . <EOS> what would we what would we achieve from it ? <EOS> and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . <EOS> so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . <EOS> i think that will be a problem because we do n't have an input device to get the listings into it , i would say no need for a talk-back . <EOS> um i mean do you wan na group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , um <other> well i think the advanced ones the the ones you do n't usually use could be hid inside . <EOS> where would you physically position the buttons ? <EOS> um energy what do you think that 's suggesting we 're how we 're powering the thing ? <EOS> i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you 'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , and this size here , i 'd suggest this be small , like quite small . <EOS> i know we 're gon na have like rubber buttons um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it 's almost like we 're reproducing the same old remote control that 's out there . <EOS> okay so so backlighting , that would be good . <EOS> um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , s so like cur slightly transparent case , so it 's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . <EOS> or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . <EOS> but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , does n't make it freaky . <EOS> um and then the other thing that we we 're s we 've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , 'cause that 's the main thing people will f wan na do . <EOS> could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? <EOS> the question is when you 're rolling it , how do you wan na roll it ? <EOS> 'cause in a mouse your hand 's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . <EOS> can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . <EOS> um it might work for volume , but not for channels right . <EOS> and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , and the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? <EOS> and that we 've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , that that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you 're left handed or you 're right handed you might be locking yourself in . <EOS> yeah i think the jog dial , what if it was flat and you just spun it , a slide , because then you you do n't have to put the hand . <EOS> and i think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that 'd just be so standard . <EOS> and also t plastic i 've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . <EOS> feel like fruit . <EOS>
uh i know that the designers are gon na be working with play-doh on that . <EOS> the next meeting 's gon na be in thirty minutes , <EOS>
um <other> i think we could go for like um <other> maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . <EOS> so something quite curvy ? <EOS>
i 'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . <EOS> um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . <EOS>
i would say no need for a talk-back . <EOS>
yeah i think the jog dial , what if it was flat and you just spun it , <EOS>
and also t plastic i 've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . <EOS>
feel like fruit . <EOS>
i know we 're gon na have like rubber buttons <EOS>
can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? <EOS> we 're gon na need to put in a really good battery so people do n't have to charge their r remote control every few days . <EOS> um energy what do you think that 's suggesting we 're how we 're powering the thing ? <EOS> i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you 'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , <EOS>
um and when the corporate colour is yellow , i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um <other> the colour , so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . <EOS> so i reckon it 'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . <EOS> and the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? <EOS> and that we 've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , <EOS>
i 'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . <EOS> um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . <EOS>
the fact that it talks to you , i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , i think that 'd probably scare me . <EOS>
also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l _ c _ d _ display , where would we put that ? <EOS> do we need an l _ c _ d _ display ? <EOS> it 's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , i would 've thought . <EOS> what would we what would we achieve from it ? <EOS> and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . <EOS> so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . <EOS> i think that will be a problem because we do n't have an input device to get the listings into it , <EOS>
but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , does n't make it freaky . <EOS> s so like cur slightly transparent case , so it 's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . <EOS> or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . <EOS> okay so so backlighting , that would be good . <EOS> um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , and that we 've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , <EOS>
so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . <EOS> could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? <EOS> the question is when you 're rolling it , how do you wan na roll it ? <EOS> 'cause in a mouse your hand 's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . <EOS> can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . <EOS> um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right . <EOS> yeah i think the jog dial , a slide , because then you you do n't have to put the hand . <EOS>
we said we were gon na have a snowman shaped remote control with no l _ c _ d _ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gon na be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal l _ e _ d _ s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . <EOS> um , there are a few changes we 've made . <EOS> um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , this is gon na be an l _ c _ d _ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm uh , apart from that , it 's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . <EOS> the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they 're hidden in the sense that um they 're not in use . <EOS> um they 're in the l _ c _ d _ panel and the jog-dial ? <EOS> the l _ c _ d _ panel just displays um functionally what you 're doing . <EOS> if you 're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say it might even be one , a bit more complex l _ c _ d _ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . <EOS> that 's a number pad . <EOS> where are we gon na have the slogan ? <EOS> just like right inside there . <EOS> <other> well <other> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that 'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <EOS> so we 're talking about ten centimetres . <EOS> we 're gon na have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . <EOS> this button um , because it 's red it 's sort of very prominent , we 're gon na use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it 'll send a stand-by signal . <EOS> um apart from that it 's gon na be used as a confirm button for the l _ c _ d _ screen oh we 've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <EOS> <laugh> be about th three and a half . <EOS> what else can you do ? <EOS> um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . <EOS> but um because we 've got the the l _ c _ d _ and the jog-dial we just thought we 'd um use that as the volume . <EOS> um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and and what else do you do with the jog-dial ? <EOS> um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . <EOS> audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . <EOS> left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , <EOS>
we can now have a little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all . <EOS> for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? <EOS> we need an advanced chip i think , yep . <EOS> we 've got push buttons as well . <EOS> okay let 's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . <EOS> the other thing could be that um you could take away the l _ c _ d _ panel and the advanced chip together , it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there 's actually one button underneath , it 's just that the panel itself is a single panel . <EOS> or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . <EOS> no can do . <EOS>
no . <EOS> do we have kinetic as well ? <EOS> and that 's because of cost restraints is it ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> i think we 're gon na have to skip the rubber . <EOS> um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , and now we 're under budget . <EOS>
i 've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , so to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , and um we 've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so the first one uh , stylish look and feel . <EOS> i rate that pretty highly . <EOS> okay let 's go with five then . <EOS> let 's go with two point five then . <EOS> high tech innovation . <EOS> so we 've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial yeah about three , okay . <EOS> style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . <EOS> okay , the blue the blue colours and do n't re do n't actually represent the colour , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , so we 'll go two . <EOS> and um design is simple to use , simple in features . <EOS> i mean i 'd give that nearly a one . <EOS> um , <other> soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? <EOS> we 've used mostly plastic in the end so it 's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . <EOS> yeah i think it 's about five . <EOS> logo , we 've got it in there , have n't we ? <EOS> and um it 's within budget , yep . <EOS>
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . <EOS> we are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . <EOS> so it 's pretty good . <EOS>
uh well next up then , because we 've done finance , is the project evaluation . <EOS> um well do you wan na um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <other> well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? <EOS> yeah , yeah it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . <EOS> but i do n't i do n't think it means the room as in this room . <EOS> so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual we 're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , answering the question uh in those terms i 'd say that actually there 's sort of a tease of creativity i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , the constraints do come in very fast . <EOS> it 's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , got ta cut everything out 'cause we do n't have enough money . <EOS> and i think the fact that we 're wearing these things restricts it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . <EOS> and and the time the time given also restricts in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <other> quite a con confining framework to work within . <EOS> and so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so but it 's not bad leadership , it 's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . <EOS> i think the interactions are very structured . <EOS> so you think maybe a little too controlling or yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . <EOS> i do n't think there 's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , uh what about teamwork ? <EOS> uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . <EOS> i think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing i would use all the time , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . <EOS> i know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it 's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and in a way everybody 's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we 're actually just each of us discussing something that 's in each of our own minds . <EOS> i think um the the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and i think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things i think . <EOS> and a lot of the information on the powerpoints , i do n't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , what about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? <EOS> oh they 're a bit clunky . <EOS> having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , but i think the pen is v is very intuitive , so i think the pen 's good . <EOS> and o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually did n't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . <EOS> we only actually needed one computer . <EOS> and the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wan na have the urge to check something , you know , well you know it 's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you 're told you must now work away from your team . <EOS> , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . <EOS> i think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on i really thi i i think maybe if we 'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c oh , i did learn something new , play-doh is useful . <EOS> it is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . <EOS> like we were playing with the play-doh and the ideas came with the play-doh rather than with everything else . <EOS> it becomes tangible . <EOS>
answering the question uh in those terms i 'd say that actually there 's sort of a tease of creativity we 're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual the constraints do come in very fast . <EOS> it 's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , got ta cut everything out 'cause we do n't have enough money . <EOS> uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . <EOS> if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would 've been a lot easier . <EOS> i think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they do n't support collaboration , i think that 's the word . <EOS> i mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way i see this i is that it 's uh the the s the structure in which we 've we 've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . <EOS> well you know it 's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you 're told you must now work away from your team . <EOS> i really thi i i think maybe if we 'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c <EOS>
no . <EOS> do we have kinetic as well ? <EOS> and that 's because of cost restraints is it ? <EOS> yep . <EOS>
the other thing could be that um you could take away the l _ c _ d _ panel and the advanced chip together , <EOS>
so we want double-curved ? <EOS>
we 've got push buttons as well . <EOS>
the other thing could be that um you could take away the l _ c _ d _ panel and the advanced chip together , <EOS>
so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t _ v _ to respond , <EOS>
um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , <EOS>
square buttons ? <EOS> yeah <EOS>
so we 're w w quite far over . <EOS> something 's gon na have to go . <EOS> um we 're at sixteen point eight and <EOS>
my name 's adam duguid , ebenezer ademesoye . <EOS> i 'm the marketing expert . <EOS> tarik rahman . <EOS> t _ a _ r _ i _ k _ . <EOS> industrial designer . <EOS> uh , dave cochrane . <EOS> and you 're going to be the user interface , <EOS>
this is the agenda for today 's meeting . <EOS> as you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . <EOS> the reason we 're here , we 're gon na design a new remote control , the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . <EOS> we 're gon na have the three kay phases , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . <EOS> um first one 's gon na be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . <EOS> second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . <EOS> ebenezer , you wan na have a you wan na draw your favourite animal <laugh> ? <EOS> <other> here we have an elephant . <EOS> tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? <EOS> uh , here we have a tiger . <EOS> uh dave , if you 'd like to uh have a dash . <EOS> um <other> um , the monkey , um . <EOS> but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , <EOS>
project finance . <EOS> as you can see , twelve point five euros per unit . <EOS> and we 're hoping to sell them for twenty five . <EOS> if we 're aiming for fifty million euros we 're gon na have to be selling an awful lot of them . <EOS> that was profiting , <EOS>
any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? <EOS> one thing i 'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l _ c _ d _ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . <EOS> and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . <EOS> with the price range we 're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive , but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . <EOS> i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for <other> um running macros . <EOS> would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the t _ v _ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d _ v _ d _ player and it turns the t _ v _ on and onto the right channel as well , um um i 've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , i 've seen the bar-code design before , instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and <other> the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . <EOS> i think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . <EOS> uh , you wan na be able to change angles in interactive television , so <other> we 'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , that 'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? <EOS> like uh control pads , you know of games , and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits <other> fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . <EOS> but of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , <other> . <EOS> small , stylish , and something that 's just a little different . <EOS> something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , <EOS>
so <other> we 'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , <EOS>
project finance . <EOS> as you can see , twelve point five euros per unit . <EOS>
and we 're hoping to sell them for twenty five . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits <other> fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . <EOS> something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , <EOS>
one thing i 'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l _ c _ d _ remotes with the price range we 're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive , <EOS>
but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . <EOS> i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the t _ v _ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d _ v _ d _ player and it turns the t _ v _ on and onto the right channel as well , um <EOS>
do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? <EOS> like uh control pads , you know of games , and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . <EOS>
we 'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . <EOS> discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the t _ v _ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . <EOS> um it 's come to my attention the following . <EOS> teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . <EOS> remote control should only be used for the t _ v _ . <EOS> um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . <EOS> um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . <EOS> just to say quickly uh i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . <EOS> to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . <EOS> um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . <EOS> um i 'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , <EOS>
functional requirement by me ebenezer . <EOS> <other> we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . <EOS> we asked some uh open ended questions , and we asked some very specific questions , please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there 's only maybe ten people <other> fifteen people in each group . <EOS> some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . <EOS> <other> most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . <EOS> there 's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . <EOS> takes too long to master the remote control . <EOS> i 've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , some of the good stuff we got . <EOS> between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . <EOS> um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , <EOS>
finally , my opinion . <EOS> the voice recognition thing is cool . <EOS> and uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . <EOS> it 's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you 're not gon na get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . <EOS> i 'm pretty sure people would buy it . <EOS> i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that <other> however , <other> oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there 's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . <EOS> but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there 's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . <EOS> there 're two options . <EOS> either you have voice recognition by itself , which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wan na be watching television and you wan na be quiet , or i do n't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote 's only trained for you , it 's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . <EOS> so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . <EOS> but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it 'll take to train the remote , <other> i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , but would they return it after a while <EOS>
this is a <other> brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . <EOS> the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because i <other> had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices i 've looked at <other> looked at a num <other> uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . <EOS> um <other> um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . <EOS> um and there 's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . <EOS> on the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . <EOS> it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . <EOS> and on the other hand there 's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what <other> what is most likely to get used . <EOS> um <other> and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , and so you go for something that 's fairly intuitive to use , my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . <EOS> um but uh the pro <other> i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user 's going to uh want mo want to do from <other> want it to do most . <EOS> something that 's uh <other> something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you 're most likely to want . <EOS> um i liked ebenezer 's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you 're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it 'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick 's <other> going to do or wha or what each function button 's going to do . <EOS>
i 'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . <EOS> so we have the energy source , we have the user interface , uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gon na add that , um , there 'd be more components to deal with that . <EOS> you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , you have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the t _ v _ do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , um , i dunno what we should decide on that . <EOS>
i hear what the marketing expert 's saying about <other> um voice activated control . <EOS> however i 've got a couple of worries about that . <EOS> <other> the power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . <EOS> um voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it 's maybe not feasible . <EOS> however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l _ c _ d _ which has been kind of put forward so far , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , i do n't know how much power an l _ c _ d _ would take , literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a <other> a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels i i was thinking that the remote <other> the um <other> sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels . <EOS> do you think that people will get mixed up , they 'll be looking at this screen and that screen um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white . <EOS> si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . <EOS> i imagine as well that the actual l _ c _ d _ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . <EOS> um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there 's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . <EOS> we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . <EOS> if you i if you wanted to access further functions i <other> you you then get to sort of menu navigation . <EOS> i mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and <other> fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t _ v _ s these days actually have menus anyway something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is . <EOS> i had one of those , because it it went off all the time accidentally . <EOS> the other option of course is that um the the clapping one . <EOS> <other> um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has somewhere where there 's a button , of course you have to have that base unit , but maybe it 's a button that you attach to the t _ v _ . <EOS> something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . <EOS> again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario i would say , that might be something that we could look into . <EOS> that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . <EOS>
but i think we do n't have a specific audience , like what is our target audience , <other> i think it could probably be aimed at most people who 've used a mobile . <EOS> um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we 're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose . <EOS> <other> um maybe then our market should be t _ v _ manufacturers , rather than the public . <EOS> however i do n't know exactly where we 'll be going with that , it 's just , the way i figure it , twelve point five euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . <EOS>
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , um we have to decide exactly what we 're going to do with the remote . <EOS> and then , what , another button that would say that it 's now being used to manoeuvre round the l _ c _ d _ . <EOS> should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? <EOS> we could use say the left and right for changing channels we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , l _ c _ d _ , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? <EOS> actually i would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we 're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . <EOS> i mean certainly something i 've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . <EOS> <other> the o the o the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? <EOS> yeah , think so . <EOS> so that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the t _ v _ , and <other> what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , light bulb as well , a small speaker you mean . <EOS> th e the true fact , considering the cost of an l _ e _ d _ , we could just incorporate it anyway . <EOS> you could go for quite an interesting design . <EOS> something that can make it stand out slightly . <EOS> i should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an l _ e _ d _ . <EOS>
teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . <EOS>
remote control should only be used for the t _ v _ . <EOS> um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . <EOS>
um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . <EOS>
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , l _ c _ d _ , <EOS>
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , l _ c _ d _ , <EOS>
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , l _ c _ d _ , <EOS>
and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? <EOS>
do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? <EOS> yeah , think so . <EOS>
<other> however , <other> oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that i 'm pretty sure people would buy it . <EOS> for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . <EOS> and uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . <EOS> the voice recognition thing is cool . <EOS> but for a very fixed number of words , it 's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you 're not gon na get good always accurate results , i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , there 's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . <EOS> but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there 's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . <EOS> there 're two options . <EOS> either you have voice recognition by itself , which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wan na be watching television and you wan na be quiet , or i do n't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote 's only trained for you , it 's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . <EOS> so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . <EOS> but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it 'll take to train the remote , <other> i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , but would they return it after a while i hear what the marketing expert 's saying about <other> um voice activated control . <EOS> however i 've got a couple of worries about that . <EOS> <other> the power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . <EOS> um voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it 's maybe not feasible . <EOS>
but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , i do n't know how much power an l _ c _ d _ would take , literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a <other> a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , do you think that people will get mixed up , they 'll be looking at this screen and that screen um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it <EOS>
i i was thinking that the remote <other> the um <other> sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels . <EOS> i imagine as well that the actual l _ c _ d _ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . <EOS> maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? <EOS> we could use say the left and right for changing channels and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? <EOS> i mean certainly something i 've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . <EOS>
i imagine as well that the actual l _ c _ d _ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . <EOS> if you i if you wanted to access further functions i <other> you you then get to sort of menu navigation . <EOS> i mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and <other> fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t _ v _ s these days actually have menus anyway and then , what , another button that would say that it 's now being used to manoeuvre round the l _ c _ d _ . <EOS>
i mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . <EOS> you want one wo <other> y you want one that 'll do the job of all of them . <EOS> this is a requirement that we have to stick to i 'm afraid , um would that include um access to say <other> interactive functions on digital or cable ? <EOS> i would say so , yes , i would say that the design spec we 've been with is for the television only for now . <EOS>
the other option of course is that um the the clapping one . <EOS> <other> um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has somewhere where there 's a button , of course you have to have that base unit , but maybe it 's a button that you attach to the t _ v _ . <EOS> something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . <EOS> again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario i would say , so that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the t _ v _ , and <other> what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , light bulb as well , a small speaker you mean . <EOS> th e the true fact , considering the cost of an l _ e _ d _ , we could just incorporate it anyway . <EOS>
i think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we 've um set out . <EOS> those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , <other> l _ c _ d _ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . <EOS> um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , and also because of the minimal design um looks like we 'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . <EOS>
this uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , the case uh le that 's what i wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . <EOS> uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . <EOS> we decide what it 's gon na be . <EOS> probably plastic . <EOS> uh we need the infra-red transmitter . <EOS> uh joystick we 'll probably if we 're gon na use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . <EOS> um three different types of batteries . <EOS> um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . <EOS> um the bat uh the battery for a a watch would n't require a lot of power , would be my one query . <EOS> is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? <EOS> and solar cells , i dunno about that . <EOS> uh . <EOS> we should probably just use conventional batteries . <EOS> um , just like in usual remote controls . <EOS> um . <EOS> <other> and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . <EOS> uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . <EOS> but uh you ca n't have a titanium one for a double curved , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? <EOS> double curved . <EOS> it probably means this is probably double curved . <EOS> uh whereas a single curved would be like that . <EOS> it looks better than the single curve , but uh you ca n't have it in titanium , and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wan na use l _ c _ d _ it 's even more expensive . <EOS> there 's trade-offs there . <EOS> um you have to decide , if you have a double curve uh control and it 's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . <EOS> i reckon you 're gon na have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . <EOS> like when we 're saying that we 'd need an advanced chip for an l _ c _ d _ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? <EOS> or ? <EOS> we have to look into the costs of those . <EOS> uh the previous slides just explain what 's in the internal components of the uh remote control . <EOS> and uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . <EOS> translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the t _ v _ . <EOS> in the information that you 've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an l _ c _ d _ looks ? <EOS> um i think we can do it if <other> uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . <EOS> um and then maybe use single curved uh case . <EOS> um i 'm actually gon na be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons i 'll go into uh in more detail . <EOS> i also have a preference for rubber . <EOS>
uh um i was given a an h _ t _ m _ l _ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . <EOS> i was n't very impressed by them uh nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we 're going for today . <EOS> rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . <EOS> um so that if r a if <other> so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . <EOS> um and what we 've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the l _ c _ d _ , i do n't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because one of the menus that we could have available um <other> v via via the l _ c _ d _ is one where you scroll through channels , you must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick 's uh left right <other> left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . <EOS> um now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we 're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . <EOS> that would suggest the double curved design 's probably going to be most appropriate , then . <EOS> and <other> also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the <other> the um you know the whole thing you know <other> it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be , you know , soft to touch the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . <EOS> and you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the l _ c _ d _ , and this would need to be articulated as well . <EOS> the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . <EOS> and then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . <EOS> programming them can be a right pain . <EOS> so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some <other> some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer and you could download programs for it from uh for uh t _ v _ s from all sort of main manufacturers . <EOS>
we compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . <EOS> and then we we research uh fashion trends in europe , uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . <EOS> as in they want it to do a lot of good s and if it does do a lot that 's a bonus , but they do n't care so much , technology technical technologically innovative . <EOS> people want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . <EOS> like the interface is really important . <EOS> <other> and easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . <EOS> <other> the fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . <EOS> how that relates to a remote control i do n't know . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> if it 's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it 's spongy , then can i skip the rest ? <EOS> the uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . <EOS> kinda spongy material . <EOS> <other> um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . <EOS> but what we what we need is something that looks like it 's from the future um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . <EOS> but if we 're gon na go along with it then it does n't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . <EOS> <other> few questions about a spongy remote control . <EOS> i 've never seen one before . <EOS> if we want something strong and sturdy , i say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , i just do n't know how the l _ e _ d _ and the lights are gon na fit into a spongy material if we 're gon na use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and also , this was this year . <EOS> things change all the time , every year <EOS>
seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , um having the use of the l _ c _ d _ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers if you 've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , what it looks like to me is we 'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , looks like we going for a double curved design . <EOS> um i do n't know what cost implications there are in that . <EOS> um , looks like we 're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . <EOS> though i 'd have to say <other> depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . <EOS> there would be basically two points of articulation . <EOS> w um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . <EOS> do you think there 's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? <EOS> but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ? <EOS> if you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , if we take some of the ideas why do n't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? <EOS> sure , yeah . <EOS> make it harder to lose , as well . <EOS> <other> the noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , <laugh> it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . <EOS> y <laugh> you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . <EOS> i was gon na talk about the programmable remote control . <EOS> now i think it 'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t _ v _ s , you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . <EOS> e each manufacturer will have a partic <other> will have a particular command set that uh the t _ v _ responds to . <EOS> but if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you 've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . <EOS> an interesting point is that if the person does n't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l _ c _ d _ um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are <other> are made , i would say . <EOS> um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that 's gon na vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . <EOS> programming it to use your t _ v _ , you might hook it up to the p _ c _ . <EOS> the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p _ c _ for a larger programming i 'm not sure , but i 'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u _ s _ b _ might be prohibitive . <EOS> i think we 've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , they 're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . <EOS> though maybe we could have options for colours as well . <EOS> <other> like i said before i i think we should have the r _ r _ on the uh on the top function button . <EOS> so we always need to remember that somewhere we 're meant to be getting the slogan on . <EOS> possibly i 'm think i 'm not sure but i 'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . <EOS> um . <EOS>
you 've got yourself and the industrial designer gon na be working quite closely at this stage looking from <laugh> prototyping of some des description using clay . <EOS> um looks like we 're gon na need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . <EOS> <laugh> <EOS>
product evaluation , does n't that come after actually seen a product prototype . <EOS> um you 're gon na look at product evaluation . <EOS>
say something like um lithium ion battery , <EOS>
looks like we going for a double curved design . <EOS>
um , looks like we 're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . <EOS>
if we take some of the ideas why do n't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? <EOS> sure , yeah . <EOS>
programming them can be a right pain . <EOS> so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some <other> some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer and you could download programs for it from uh for uh t _ v _ s from all sort of main manufacturers . <EOS> i was gon na talk about the programmable remote control . <EOS> now i think it 'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t _ v _ s , you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . <EOS> e each manufacturer will have a partic <other> will have a particular command set that uh the t _ v _ responds to . <EOS> but if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you 've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . <EOS> an interesting point is that if the person does n't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l _ c _ d _ programming it to use your t _ v _ , you might hook it up to the p _ c _ . <EOS> the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p _ c _ for a larger programming i 'm not sure , but i 'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u _ s _ b _ might be prohibitive . <EOS>
like i said before i i think we should have the r _ r _ on the uh on the top function button . <EOS> so we always need to remember that somewhere we 're meant to be getting the slogan on . <EOS> possibly i 'm think i 'm not sure but i 'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . <EOS> um . <EOS>
just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , uh many of our components are gon na be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gon na require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l _ c _ d _ display . <EOS> um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gon na be double curved , etcetera . <EOS> due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype . <EOS> quite how the best way to do this is , i 'm not sure , i think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas . <EOS> do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . <EOS> um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh l _ e _ d _ . <EOS> as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , but as you as you see with the uh <other> with holding it in the left hand , the l _ uh the l _ c _ d _ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we 're going to retain ergonomic design . <EOS> this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . <EOS> though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . <EOS> i i got your note about uh keeping the cost down . <EOS> as for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , really the curve that 's most needed is the underside um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . <EOS> um obviously it 's gon na be bulkier than how it looks , because it 's gon na be flat on one side , and it 's plastic as well , so it wo n't be as comfortable on the hand . <EOS> if we could if we could still do the rubber , i though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh <other> of the rigid substructure . <EOS> so it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist <EOS>
basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . <EOS> it 's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . <EOS> seven scale . <EOS> after we 've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and uh the criteria based on real reactions ' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those i put together from the user requirements phase . <EOS> those are the criteria . <EOS> and uh perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we 've totally abandoned , which means <other> that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . <EOS> we have to go through each point . <EOS> and just give it a a score . <EOS> uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . <EOS> i mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still yeah , that 's still part of the design . <EOS> i mean i do n't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , mm . <EOS> and making it a bright colour helps we still have that noise thing , on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it 's lost ? <EOS> i 'd say number one . <EOS> just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we 'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you 're gon na evaluate , and then we 'll come back to the product evaluation is that real reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . <EOS> something i neglected from my initial research that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and then we 'll come back pretty much promptly to this . <EOS> and uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? <EOS> i guess it 's just the same as saying easy to use interface , and we can come back to it , you said . <EOS> slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . <EOS>
slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . <EOS> um most of it stems from the use of the l _ c _ d _ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l _ c _ d _ , at which point we 've removed a large part of how we were gon na interface , or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . <EOS> um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs we 've got point two of a euro left over there . <EOS> even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i 've used what i think 's appropriate . <EOS> it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a u _ s _ b _ connection is definitely not viable now . <EOS> um . <EOS> we 've got an advanced chip , we 've got the use of the l _ c _ d _ . <EOS> i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the l _ c _ d _ would n't be in this perfect place . <EOS> mm-hmm i suppose o one thing that could be done is h <other> is have it um circular do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? <EOS> i mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ? <EOS> you now have as much information as i do . <EOS> <laugh> um . <EOS> i 've said single curved . <EOS> we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . <EOS> um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , if i 've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a euro here in that it 's not per push button . <EOS> as you can see , the use of an l _ c _ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well i 'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . <EOS> uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? <EOS> have we factored that in ? <EOS> uh no , we have n't , not transmitter , receiver , speakers . <EOS> plus the extra device itself that 's gon na be on a t _ v _ . <EOS> that 's too expensive mm . <EOS> i think if we remove the the l _ c _ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings if we remove the l _ c _ display , we could save ourselves if we could 've increased the price we could 've manufactured that and we could 've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . <EOS> um but for the purposes of this meeting , i 'm we 're gon na have to stick with these figures . <EOS> i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we 're gon na keep the l _ c _ display are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the l _ c _ d _ ? <EOS> i mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep i mean <other> keep the um the articulation ? <EOS> um i would say that you 're at least gon na take double curved , it can still be single curved , could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? <EOS> so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . <EOS> sample speaker ? <EOS> what is a sample speaker ? <EOS> that 's that voice response thing that we got the email about . <EOS> but i thought it was just completely pointless . <EOS> b i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice . <EOS> <other> it looks like we 're gon na get rid of the whole loca <other> locator thing . <EOS> one point five of a euro for one push button does n't sound quite right . <EOS> l let 's say that and then we can have our special coloured case i quite like that colour that you 're fetching there , yellow . <EOS> <other> make it glow in the dark even better . <EOS>
we 'll come back to uh your evaluation just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , <EOS>
ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . <EOS> three . <EOS> i think we can do three . <EOS> reduce the number of unused buttons . <EOS> i 'd say we 're doing well there . <EOS> easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus we 're not doing so badly . <EOS> um <other> easy to use let 's forget that one . <EOS> fancy looking . <EOS> <other> it does n't get much fancier . <EOS> technologically innovative . <EOS> we 're getting rid of the locator thing mm . <EOS> i 'd give it a three for this for that . <EOS> i mean the menus thing is something you do n't normally see on um on a remote , materials that people find pleasing . <EOS> sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . <EOS> plastic , it sucks . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i 'd s i i 'd give it a six , to be honest . <EOS> that 's totally thrown everything off balance . <EOS> inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . <EOS> i i i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours . <EOS> um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype leopard print would be cool . <EOS> but um by this i think it 's more a case of fruit and veg , it would also help keep the the product placement is this like a banana type colour ? <EOS> it 's not shaped like a banana is i i think s i i think this is n't not particularly fruit and veggie . <EOS> um . <EOS> i mean it 's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , mm . <EOS> i 'd <other> i 'd i do n't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . <EOS> <laugh> is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . <EOS> and we can make it yellow , and that 's pretty much banana like . <EOS> yeah , i 'll go with five . <EOS>
we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . <EOS> so five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . <EOS> which gives us an average of three . <EOS> it 's it 's not bad . <EOS> considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um are people really gon na shell out twenty five euros for something that 's only marginally good ? <EOS>
um quickly we 'll pop onto project evaluation . <EOS> um . <EOS> we 've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . <EOS> does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? <EOS> um people made good use of the uh pen and paper ? <EOS> i 'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . <EOS> i think this is a i think the digital pen 's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this . <EOS> though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves . <EOS> how are people satisfied with the teamwork we 've managed to display today ? <EOS> good . <EOS> yeah i liked it , leadership . <EOS> as much as can be leadered in this uh thing . <EOS> very good . <EOS> um last one we 've got is room for creativity . <EOS> <other> unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , we 're burs bursting with creativity . <EOS> we we 're not lacking in ideas , i think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly . <EOS> not so much that we were n't full of ideas , but of ones that are gon na allow us to actually build the thing . <EOS> i think we needed a larger budget . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i mean i th <other> i mean i think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh i i think it 's gone okay today , considering the information that we 've had at our disposal , and um such . <EOS> maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more yeah , to begin with . <EOS> it is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . <EOS> is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um before i quickly write up a final report . <EOS> but we 've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . <EOS> <laugh> i was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . <EOS>
we 've got the use of the l _ c _ d _ . <EOS> i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we 're gon na keep the l _ c _ display <EOS>
as for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , because it 's gon na be flat on one side , i 've said single curved . <EOS> so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . <EOS>
l let 's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and we can make it yellow , <EOS>
this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . <EOS> is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , <EOS>
was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . <EOS> um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . <EOS> at which point we 've removed a large part of how we were gon na interface , um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l _ c _ d _ , which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure we 've got point two of a euro left over there . <EOS> even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i 've used what i think 's appropriate . <EOS> it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a u _ s _ b _ connection is definitely not viable now . <EOS> um . <EOS> i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , if i 've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a euro here in that it 's not per push button . <EOS> um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , this one comes in under price as you can see , uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? <EOS> have we factored that in ? <EOS> uh no , we have n't , not that 's too expensive if we remove the l _ c _ display , we could save ourselves i mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep i mean <other> keep the um the articulation ? <EOS> um i would say that you 're at least gon na take double curved , it can still be single curved , <EOS>
um most of it stems from the use of the l _ c _ d _ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l _ c _ d _ , at which point we 've removed a large part of how we were gon na interface , we 've got the use of the l _ c _ d _ . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think if we remove the the l _ c _ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings if we remove the l _ c _ display , we could save ourselves i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we 're gon na keep the l _ c _ display <EOS>
um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . <EOS> um i would say that you 're at least gon na take double curved , it can still be single curved , could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . <EOS>
um i 'm sarah , the project manager okay , this is our agenda , um <other> get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . <EOS> um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um now , we 're developing a remote control which you probably already know . <EOS> um , we want it to be original , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . <EOS>
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um , conceptual design , and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work . <EOS>
we 're gon na practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . <EOS> i 'm going to tell you that 's supposed to be a tiger . <EOS> uh , maybe you can guess what i 'm trying to make ? <EOS> a kind of dog ? <EOS> okay , now i 'm gon na have to change what is was originally gon na be <cough> yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . <EOS> it 's meant to be an eagle <laugh> <EOS>
um finance-wise , we 've got a selling price at twenty five euros , which i do n't actually know what that is in pounds , at all . <EOS> seventeen . <EOS> okay , that 's expensive . <EOS> havi having said that though , if you wan na get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they 're s they 're about twenty pounds anyway . <EOS> um production cost 's at twelve fifty , so um , and profit aim is fifty million euros , you 've got market range international and you did say earlier it 's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups <EOS>
what are your experiences with remote controls ? <EOS> i mean i 've got we got um we had three videos , a t _ v _ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals but that was quite good , the fact that you could you did n't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . <EOS> my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and symbols that you do n't necessarily understand , so simplification of symbols you could think of . <EOS> and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . <EOS> the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control <EOS>
but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it 's got a menu display , i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you 've got a little l _ c _ d _ display . <EOS> instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an l _ c _ d _ di display or something like that , what about the older generation ? <EOS> that 's gon na be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , i do n't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows-based running system . <EOS> i find it really confusing , yeah , i do n't i do n't know how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you 'd you 'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l _ c _ d _ thing anyway , i 'd assume . <EOS>
and there 's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? <EOS> something that 's easily moulded and produced . <EOS> about what you 're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? <EOS> i i had a quick look at the company website and it 's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , i mean you do n't you you can still have plastic we do n't have to use metal , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , i mean there 's sky remote controls and everything . <EOS> they 're kind of moulded so yeah i guess that 's stuff we can think about . <EOS>
so we 're all gon na go off and do our individual things . <EOS> um and then we 'll come back and liaise again okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have <EOS>
yeah , i do n't i do n't know how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you 'd you 'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l _ c _ d _ thing anyway , i 'd assume . <EOS> the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control i think that 's a cost thing , <EOS>
okay this is uh the working design , what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? <EOS> well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the t _ v _ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t _ v _ or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to . <EOS> um , so i decided i 'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . <EOS> but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wan na make sure that our design stands out <EOS>
um and uh <cough> i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t _ v _ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . <EOS> now our one , i 'm i 'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did n't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . <EOS> you 're saying the triple a _ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? <EOS> if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they 're quite they 're quite chunky and that 's because of the size of the batteries , the triple a _ s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? <EOS> well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . <EOS> and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres we 've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the <other> uh u _ i _ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i _ r _ data which could be decoded by the t _ v _ receiver , which obviously means that we 're gon na have to conform to <other> whatever um whatever form of communication that the t _ v _ s are already using so all the components that i 've put forward are uh low in cost um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , because they 're small they 're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa <laugh> thing that you could have , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william 's just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing and to summarise i i would say it 's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . <EOS> so what the concept is to have a flip-top model . <EOS> the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . <EOS> and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . <EOS> if you ask me personally , i would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . <EOS> and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard <EOS>
i 'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view we used our our usability lab , the company 's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , <other> our findings , lots of findings , i 've just summarised some of them here . <EOS> the overall thing which i 've i 've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <EOS> eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , but um that 's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that 's a bit nicer looking . <EOS> um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . <EOS> for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , <other> um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do n't have so many functions actually on the remote control . <EOS> um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . <EOS> uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . <EOS> um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they 've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . <EOS> something we did n't put to them , but which i 'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . <EOS> so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , if there 's any more information i can email you extra details , <EOS>
we have new project requirements , um we 're not going to be using teletext , our control is only going to be for t _ v _ , it 's not going to be a combined control , i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but <other> i do n't know , what do you think ? <EOS> would that imply video use ? <EOS> but i mean , general t _ v _ controls do do video as well . <EOS> i think we assume that it 's still got play and stop functions and <other> programming . <EOS> ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it 'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing um <other> the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . <EOS> um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , <EOS>
further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it 's gon na be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who 's sixty and also across the world if we 're aiming at the international market . <EOS> i 'm thinking kind of japan , i 'm thinking uh young , um office people , <EOS>
okay , so the remote control functions . <EOS> um we 've got the t _ v _ , we 've got the video , now there 's um i ca n't remember what it 's called , the little code at the end of programme details , video plus . <EOS> we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , and you would n't you would n't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , i 've not come across that function if you look in the newspaper , t _ v _ guide or any t _ v _ guide there 's a five , six digit number afterwards i 'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , um , what other functions ? <EOS> oh batteries , that 's what i was thinking about . <EOS> mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? <EOS> th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you 're not using it or t at night or something , um , something like that should reduce the size of it . <EOS> yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? <EOS> rechargeable with a docking station . <EOS> and we 've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . <EOS>
but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that 's kind of what led us on to comparing t _ v _ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you 've got any problems with it and they 'll fix it , is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it i press for this ? <EOS> th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? <EOS> but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract but i i 'm not sure how much the cost would be of having i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that . <EOS> instruction manuals . <EOS> there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . <EOS> but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible <EOS>
um , th the shape you got trendy . <EOS> i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . <EOS> so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , so it 's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . <EOS> i would n't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . <EOS> i mean for example , if it was a c _ or something like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , you know even though we 're using plastic , you can still i mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , you could have different kind of casings . <EOS> so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs <EOS>
and the i the instruction manual , i do n't know if we deal with that , um . <EOS> what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? <EOS>
i think we have to design one product th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . <EOS>
i 'm thinking uh young , um office people , i 'm thinking kind of japan , <EOS>
i mean for example , if it was a c _ or something like that , you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , i think that 's <other> that sounds a really attractive idea , um something about videoplus . <EOS> video plus . <EOS>
mm , and the rechargeable batteries . <EOS> rechargeable with a docking station . <EOS> so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? <EOS> you could have different kind of casings . <EOS> so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . <EOS>
ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it 'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing we do have a budget limitation that we ca n't control ourselves , so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing yeah but um on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it 'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is <EOS>
the minutes from the last time . <EOS> um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . <EOS> we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal . <EOS> we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , and we were gon na think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , <EOS>
and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . <EOS> um <other> the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . <EOS> <other> uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . <EOS> they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . <EOS> now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . <EOS> um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . <EOS> there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , <EOS>
um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . <EOS> 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available . <EOS> this is uh the chip called the t _ a _ double one eight three five which is what 's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input um and then we we 're loo looking into battery options . <EOS> there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , i saw the um the standard double a _ and triple a _ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , so you wind up your remote control before you use it . <EOS> like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got t _ v _ . <EOS> i 'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . <EOS> but i i think i think the the next one 's the best anyway . <EOS> the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you 'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , it like it runs for long time ? <EOS> well i do i d i 'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i 've never seen one run out . <EOS> referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? <EOS> ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case on a calculator they they 're qui they 're quite big and they all they all look i identical . <EOS> yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . <EOS> 'cause if we 're doing the kinetic thing should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , but it 's something to put on the side to think about maybe . <EOS> most current remotes use this silicone uh p _ c _ b _ board which pr printed circuit board , the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they 've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons um , the case material , i 've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , which i think we were gon na go for anyway as the main case case housing there 's the plastic well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical . <EOS> titanium um very expensive just to process , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . <EOS> yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , so in this case if you 're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . <EOS> i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , well that 's been really popular with mobile phones so i do n't see why not . <EOS> but i thought that an l _ c _ d _ type of screen the problem with it basically is that it 's flat and so you ca n't do lots of curve curved things with it , i do n't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that you could have a flat screen inside , yeah , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r _ s _ i _ . <EOS> i think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gon na be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . <EOS> <other> is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to < makes clicking sounds with tongue > . <EOS> but i i think they could get a bit easily lost , is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it 's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . <EOS> we 're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . <EOS> you were sitting watching t _ v _ are you gon na want to sort of open it and say oh shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t _ <laugh> <EOS>
the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you 'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , 'cause if we 're doing the kinetic thing should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , but it 's something to put on the side to think about maybe . <EOS> there 's the plastic which i think we were gon na go for anyway as the main case case housing so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , <EOS>
we are going to have m maybe a g _ g _ u _ i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . <EOS> the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . <EOS> so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . <EOS> and uh second thing is there 's too much of confusion here . <EOS> basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . <EOS> can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? <EOS> so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . <EOS> repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . <EOS> we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . <EOS> so i would n't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern <EOS>
okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . <EOS> we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . <EOS>
i 'm not sure how long we 've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we 've discussed . <EOS> do we agree on the battery ? <EOS> the kinetic . <EOS> so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . <EOS> um , that means that there 's no function for li the port , i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it 's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , the l _ c _ d _ 's not cheap . <EOS> maybe we could start with the black and white . <EOS> the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is n't it ? <EOS> did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ? <EOS> the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . <EOS> yeah the well i think were we 're going for the l _ c _ d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the bottom we were gon na have the rubber , the rubber ones , um , okay on we 've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gon na be the l _ c _ d _ and the bottom one is gon na be the rubberised buttons . <EOS> for the body design i think plastic , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , we 're not gon na try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , this would definitely be different enough , i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little and incorporating the company logo ? <EOS> 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it 's not just a case of having a little r _ r _ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it 's our product i think you just address that with um advertising . <EOS> obviously it 'll have a logo on it just like everything , the point is that it 's got to stand out somehow differently i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? <EOS> yeah , depending on the expense of it . <EOS>
do we agree on the battery ? <EOS> the kinetic . <EOS> um , that means that there 's no function for li the port , the l _ c _ d _ 's not cheap . <EOS> maybe we could start with the black and white . <EOS> the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . <EOS> did we decide on double a _ or triple a _ batteries ? <EOS> yeah the well i think were we 're going for the l _ c _ d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the bottom we were gon na have the rubber , the rubber ones , um , okay on we 've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gon na be the l _ c _ d _ and the bottom one is gon na be the rubberised buttons . <EOS> for the body design i think plastic , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , we 're not gon na try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , this would definitely be different enough , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little <EOS>
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . <EOS> i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it 's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . <EOS> yeah , depending on the expense of it . <EOS> have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? <EOS>
the kinetic . <EOS> so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . <EOS> i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it 's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , yeah the well i think were we 're going for the l _ c _ d _ on that one , on the buttons , on the bottom we were gon na have the rubber , the rubber ones , um , okay on we 've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gon na be the l _ c _ d _ and the bottom one is gon na be the rubberised buttons . <EOS> so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . <EOS>
'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available . <EOS> there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , <EOS>
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available . <EOS> there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , <EOS>
um we decided to use a kinetic charger , standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , we wanted a stand-by function . <EOS> the case material is gon na be soft , rubbery , changeable . <EOS> um buttons with a combination of l _ c _ d _ and rubber according to the design . <EOS> um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . <EOS> um <other> and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . <EOS> um <other> and the rubber buttons that we 'll use will be anti-r _ s _ i _ . <EOS>
prototype presentation . <EOS> me and william worked on a prototype , and i think william is going to make a p presentation on that . <EOS> i can hold it like and i 'll i 'll show you the presentation . <EOS> and we 'll first look at the exterior of what we 've uh come up with over there . <EOS> um it 's gon na have a a plastic body <other> um with a sort of standard colour , either we 're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . <EOS> this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there 'd be sort of a wide choice um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , um <cough> it 's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design <other> and uh <cough> the um the top l _ c _ d _ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um <other> how do you say , it 's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top the black and white touch screen and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it 'll fully close flat . <EOS> we 've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in <other> and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they 'd also be quite cheap . <EOS> so you 'd have something like where you 'd shout out , where where is the remote and it 'll shout back , i 'm here , or something . <EOS> um the standard , there 's be a standard transmission with the t _ v _ using using all the standard chips that we 've talked about . <EOS> obviously 'cause it 's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p _ c _ b _ s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . <EOS> <other> and uh because , obviously , all t _ v _ s use this , the same infrared medium , we 'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . <EOS> and the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the so when you 've actually got it open , it would be facing the t _ v _ . <EOS> and then finally um on to the interface . <EOS> <other> the top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white l _ c _ d _ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . <EOS> and now we 've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . <EOS> but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product and finally that 's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that 's the company logo . <EOS>
um i 've now got evaluation criteria . <EOS> this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . <EOS> the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . <EOS> are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? <EOS> so it 's what we 've discussed in the last meeting , the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . <EOS> <other> the design should minimise r _ s _ i _ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , we 're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . <EOS> and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . <EOS> is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the market w we 'll discuss each one and we 'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . <EOS> i wo n't write all of that out again . <EOS> it will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . <EOS> so i 'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who 's who . <EOS> criteria a _ , the fancy look and feel . <EOS> my own rating for that would be a two . <EOS> two and three quarters ? <EOS> criteria b _ , criterion b _ , technologically innovative . <EOS> i would give that a three . <EOS> i 'd give it a one . <EOS> it 's just two point five for that one . <EOS> ease of use . <EOS> based on what you 've said there , i would say a one , true . <EOS> i would say a two . <EOS> i would say a two . <EOS> one point seven f five . <EOS> it incorporates current fashion trends , i 'm just thinking , before i give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . <EOS> is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? <EOS> the the base colour was um <other> white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it 's full sort of customised . <EOS> so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that 's what we 're intending to do . <EOS> 'cause th that 's that 's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , in that case it 's got to be a one for me . <EOS> yeah , i 'll give it a one as well . <EOS> to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . <EOS> i do n't think we 've really touched on that a lot . <EOS> we have n't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . <EOS> but the very use of a remote control , if you 're someone who 's zapping , who 's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? <EOS> the type of button that we 're gon na use in the bottom half , the material , minimises r _ s _ i _ but with the amount of stuff we 're putting on it is n't that much . <EOS> i think i 'm gon na have to be neutral on that and give it a four . <EOS> i 'd uh i 'd f i 'd go for a five , actually , and finally , last but not least , easy to locate . <EOS> now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? <EOS> yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , and are we happy with the costs on that ? <EOS> that is going to be feasible , cost-wise . <EOS> yeah , yeah , that yeah , that 's feasible . <EOS> it would be quite loud . <EOS> and if you did n't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you 'd realise that it was n't in that room , you 'd go into another room . <EOS> that 's a one for me . <EOS> <other> i do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , we 've got our our we 've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . <EOS> that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . <EOS> the lowest rating we 've got , which is really n it 's not terribly low , i it 's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . <EOS>
<other> do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? <EOS> i do n't think so . <EOS> we happy to go ahead ? <EOS> i think we yeah . <EOS> i think we 're set . <EOS> i think for most of those ratings that it 's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , i 'll just leave it there . <EOS> and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . <EOS>
i 've got finance here now . <EOS> we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . <EOS> so are we still on for kinetic ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . <EOS> um it might have influenced our choice . <EOS> it was a regular chip on print you you 've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . <EOS> one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . <EOS> one double curve . <EOS> 'cause it 's two . <EOS> what 's a single curve then ? <EOS> it would just be a flat bottom with one curve . <EOS> like a domed thing . <EOS> <other> um we 've got plastic and rubber , i think rubber , since it 's being used just as a casing , see , it says case material . <EOS> we 're not actually using plastic in the case , there 's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . <EOS> so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? <EOS> or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . <EOS> special colour , do we need that ? <EOS> might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . <EOS> the push-button 's one and l _ c _ display one . <EOS> <other> i think we could change the battery also . <EOS> instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . <EOS> and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ? <EOS> so the highest we 've got is the electronics here . <EOS> um <other> and the interface . <EOS> if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? <EOS> it <other> um it would make one difference . <EOS> what i feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . <EOS> but if you take away the voice recognition , then you 've got it . <EOS> if you took away that , that 'll make it twelve point three five . <EOS> if we change it to the battery it 's that 's minus three . <EOS>
but if you take away the voice recognition , then you 've got it . <EOS> if you took away that , that 'll make it twelve point three five . <EOS> we could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . <EOS> i do n't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . <EOS> we can put in our recommendations . <EOS> if we if we 're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team 's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we 've we 've found and what we the consensus that we 've come to as a result of the meetings . <EOS> um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers so if we take voice recognition out that 'll do it . <EOS> twelve point three five . <EOS> we are close to the budget . <EOS> is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? <EOS> so we are under the budget . <EOS>
product evaluation . <EOS> we 've done room for creativity , because we 've got decisions that we would have made that we were n't did n't feel able to make . <EOS> um i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . <EOS> although we had our separate tasks , i think we had a nice time . <EOS> there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . <EOS> in that in relevant areas we 've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . <EOS> yeah , i think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . <EOS> we came to a very predic creative design , yeah . <EOS> and sarah , you coordinated the work very well . <EOS> although we did n't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that 's that 's good . <EOS> i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we 'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , i think maybe it would 've come out a d little different , i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it 'd be suggested that that was n't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you two created that wonderful specimen of a play-doh model . <EOS>
i think we had a nice time . <EOS> although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . <EOS> in that in relevant areas we 've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . <EOS> yeah , i think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . <EOS> we came to a very predic creative design , yeah . <EOS> and sarah , you coordinated the work very well . <EOS> although we did n't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that 's that 's good . <EOS> i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we 'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , i think maybe it would 've come out a d little different , i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it 'd be suggested that that was n't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you two created that wonderful specimen of a play-doh model . <EOS>
i think it 's really good that this has been very market research based , because <other> just going back to mobile phones , i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . <EOS> we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that 's where we 've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . <EOS> there are innovations in that that people do n't really want . <EOS> and i think it 's wonderful our company 's so r _ and d _ based . <EOS>
um <other> our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , do you think that 's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? <EOS> and the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? <EOS> i think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . <EOS> i think we 've done very well to get within budget <EOS>
um and we 've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . <EOS> there 's a final questionnaire . <EOS> we 've got about fifty minutes to catch up with <other> <laugh> everything that i fell behind with , <EOS>
if we if we 're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team 's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we 've we 've found and what we the consensus that we 've come to as a result of the meetings . <EOS> with recommendations that they the budget be increased , <EOS>
there 's a final questionnaire . <EOS> we 've got about fifty minutes to catch up with <other> <laugh> everything that i fell behind with , <EOS>
um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in <other> and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they 'd also be quite cheap . <EOS> so you 'd have something like where you 'd shout out , where where is the remote and it 'll shout back , i 'm here , or something . <EOS> though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , and are we happy with the costs on that ? <EOS> that is going to be feasible , cost-wise . <EOS> yeah , yeah , that yeah , that 's feasible . <EOS>
we could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . <EOS> i do n't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . <EOS> we can put in our recommendations . <EOS> if we if we 're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team 's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we 've we 've found and what we the consensus that we 've come to as a result of the meetings . <EOS> um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers so if we take voice recognition out that 'll do it . <EOS> twelve point three five . <EOS>
it 's gon na have a a plastic body <other> um with a sort of standard colour , either we 're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . <EOS> this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , um which there 'd be sort of a wide choice <EOS>
the black and white touch screen <other> the top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white l _ c _ d _ s touch screen <EOS>
and now we 've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . <EOS>
we happy to go ahead ? <EOS> i think we yeah . <EOS> i think we 're set . <EOS> i think for most of those ratings that it 's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . <EOS>
see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . <EOS> um it might have influenced our choice . <EOS> with recommendations that they the budget be increased , <EOS>
um it might have influenced our choice . <EOS> see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . <EOS> with recommendations that they the budget be increased , <EOS>
so presumably that might be an idea to put into . <EOS> so maybe we could think about colour ? <EOS> so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , what do we think a good size would be for this ? <EOS>
i think the the only ones that i 've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things yeah the universal ones . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so presumably that might be an idea to put into . <EOS> so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , <EOS>
so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , what do we think a good size would be for this ? <EOS> kind of um , maybe more like a p _ d _ a _ kind of , just hand held , <EOS>
so you do the looking around at other remote controls . <EOS> and you could look into um <other> basically how how it 's made i _ e _ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . <EOS> so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? <EOS> shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . <EOS>
so you do the looking around at other remote controls . <EOS>
so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? <EOS> shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . <EOS>
and you could look into um <other> basically how how it 's made i _ e _ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . <EOS>
uh , yes , i have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey . <EOS> seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . <EOS> uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . <EOS> uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . <EOS> but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . <EOS> because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . <EOS> because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , they find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . <EOS>
uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . <EOS> uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . <EOS> but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . <EOS> because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , they find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . <EOS>
if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . <EOS> because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , <EOS>
uh i 'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user i want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . <EOS> but i 've got some pictures here of some leading ones . <EOS> these are two leading um remote controls at the moment . <EOS> i mean this one 's got loads of buttons , um , personally i prefer this one just because it 's looks easier use , it 's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , um , well i think we need to l i think the ergonomics is quite um important , um and um i thought not too edgy and like a box , so i think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . <EOS> was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it 's a pain when you run out of batteries . <EOS> and uh i was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? <EOS> is that a function we want in the remote ? <EOS> you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it 's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? <EOS> . <EOS> <laugh> um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , uh and then , what would the response be ? <EOS> it beeps back at you or something ? <EOS>
and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . <EOS> and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it 'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it 'll beep back and say you know oh here i am or something of this sort . <EOS> but sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you 're likely to get it beeping back at you . <EOS> and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . <EOS> so i think i i missed the budget thing , it was fifty million euros ? <EOS> so we 're making that at twelve and a half euros a time . <EOS> well i guess more realistically then , we need a product that 's got some kinda nifty outer casing , an energy source which 'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <other> cheap plastic uh , you know , would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? <EOS> yeah , yeah , we could do that too . <EOS> or a little base station or something , . <EOS> uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we 're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you do n't have to worry about . <EOS> um so here 's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . <EOS> uh personal preferences , i think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it 's not blasting . <EOS> and the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it 's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . <EOS>
right , also so um a notice i got not very long before the meeting , we had that um to dis-include teletext um because it 's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . <EOS> um it 's only for the television , and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . <EOS> um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything 's yellow . <EOS> and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh <EOS>
okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we 're going to actually have . <EOS> speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , l _ c _ d _ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i 'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i 'm getting sent is that they 're quite interested in a t _ f _ t _ display , interactive display . <EOS> um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? <EOS> but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , i know of no products um that use speech recognition well . <EOS> but what about um something that 's built into the t _ v _ um that you can press and it 'll send out a little signal um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . <EOS> you just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it 's within you know , within hearing range . <EOS> <other> i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . <EOS> we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . <EOS> there 's a good chance the the t _ f _ t _ screen would break or uh get damaged . <EOS> so we 'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . <EOS> um i think we 're gon na scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a oh no it 's it 's much cheaper than the t _ f _ t _ , it 's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . <EOS> so we 'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? <EOS> um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . <EOS> glow in dark . <EOS> if it 's not too expensive s i think it 's a good gimmick . <EOS> and also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <EOS> <other> <other> what i thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , um , a bit more <other> durable and that can also be ergonomic so <laugh> we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . <EOS>
