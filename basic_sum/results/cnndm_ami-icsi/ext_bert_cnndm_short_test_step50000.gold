decisions: a single<q>large<q>round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants
problems: there was some confusion about the agenda
abstract: there are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for tv only<q>they should ignore the teletext function<q>as it is dated<q>and<q>also<q>the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product
problems: replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote
decisions: a recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption
abstract: he also mentioned the possibility of using an lcd screen to add something special
decisions: an lcd screen is going to be used to display information<q>but would not be interactive

decisions: the group will design a trendy<q>original and user-friendly remote control
decisions: the remote control will be sold for 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros
abstract: for the conceptual design<q>the marketing expert talked about the public 's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation ; however<q>they both seem to be more important than ease of use
decisions: the logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote ; the company slogan will be engraved at the back
abstract: it also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition
decisions: specific ideas as to components and materials are to be left to the next meeting
decisions: the less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip<q>as it had been previously suggested<q>as there are not that many of them ; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones
problems: plastic may be strong<q>but it does not necessarily look it
abstract: there are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for tv only<q>they should ignore the teletext function<q>as it is dated<q>and<q>also<q>the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product

decisions: the remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour
abstract: the use of infrared<q>energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested
problems: changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium<q>but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter

abstract: a fancy look and feel is most important to users<q>followed by technological innovation and ease of use
action: the project manager will write up the minutes and put them in the shared folder<q>using a keyboard instead of the digital pen

abstract: the remote could light up via led 's placed inside
decisions: led 's can be used to light up the remote
abstract: other functions are served by push buttons: ok<q>menu<q>screen sizing<q>av<q>settings buttons<q>mute<q>digits 1-9<q>power<q>volume control<q>channel up / down with the last three types being prominent on the device
abstract: the buttons include oval digit buttons<q>arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle ; below those<q>is the menu ( for the lcd ) and the video button

abstract: the project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting
abstract: he stressed that a trendy design is important<q>that users zap a lot<q>and that remotes often get lost
decisions: the buttons will consist of number<q>a menu button<q>arrows for changing channel and volume<q>but also navigating the menu<q>and a mute button
abstract: this was done on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) -7 ( very bad ) on fancifulness<q>ease of use<q>finding the device when it is lost<q>hi-tech features<q>incorporation of fashion trends<q>and ergonomic design

abstract: the industrial designer reported on working design<q>explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components
abstract: the project manager went over the roles of the participants and closed the meeting
problems: the only way was to go to a regular chip<q>but that would mean losing the lcd screen<q>which was integral to the design
problems: the group were dissatisfied with the final product
abstract: the function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip<q>and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared
decisions: the team agreed to place the lcd at the bottom of the device<q>below the buttons
decisions: despite disagreement regarding the position of the lcd ( top or bottom )<q>the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype
problems: whether to use a joystick rather than a scroll button to navigate the menu
problems: the project manager had problems using the digital pen to write the minutes

abstract: the user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design
problems: a discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons ( power<q>channel selection<q>volume ) where they can be easily reached with the thumb ( as many users complain of rsi )<q>did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements
